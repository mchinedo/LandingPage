## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

My topic for my landing project is the Black Community at Brown University! As a recent Brown Graduate, I've received many questions from prospective students about what it's like being "Black at Brown". As a result, I thought this landing page could be a good way to highlight a little bit of the the Black experience at Brown, as well as provide resources for people who want to learn more!

I utilized DOM Elements, foreach loops, if else statements, event listeners, window specific functions, information from Brown University Black Student Group Websites and social media accounts, as well as specific styling elements.

To get started, you will need a browser (I utilized Google Chrome) and a text editor (I used Atom).
You will need at least a one css, js, and index file. But you are free to create more as needed!

You can get started by simply opening your index.html file with your browser!
