            Black@Brown is a term created by Black Students at Brown University
            to provide a space for Black Students navigating a predominately
            white institution. From being the title of GroupMe Chat names, to
            slogans on t-shirts, the term "Black@Brown" became very popular and
            is a huge part of the day to day lives of Black students at Brown.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout my time at Brown, I've gotten several requests from
            aspiring and incoming Black Brown University students about what it
            is really like being a Black Person at Brown University. Therefore,
            I decided to make this landing page highlighting the major events
            that the Black community looks forward to every year!
          </p>

          <p>
            There are numerous amounts of events and traditions in the Black
            community, and my hope is that one day, all interested students will
            get to experience them! In the meantime, I've listed 3 major events
            below to provide a quick glimpse into what it's like being
            "Black@Brown"<br />
            <br />I hope you enjoy!
